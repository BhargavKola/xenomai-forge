/*
 * The motivation to centralize tracing information about relaxes
 * directly into kernel space is fourfold:
 *
 * - it allows to gather all the trace data into a single location and
 * keep it safe there, with no external log file involved.
 *
 * - enabling the tracing does not impose any requirement on the
 * application (aside of being compiled with debug symbols for best
 * interpreting that information). We only need a kernel config switch
 * for this (i.e. CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_TRACE_RELAX).
 *
 * - the data is collected and can be made available exactly the same
 * way regardless of the application emitting the relax requests, or
 * whether it is still alive when the trace data are displayed.
 *
 * - the kernel is able to provide accurate and detailed trace
 * information, such as the relative offset of instructions causing
 * relax requests within dynamic shared objects, without having to
 * guess it roughly from /proc/pid/maps, or relying on ldd's
 * --function-relocs feature, which both require to run on the target
 * system to get the needed information. Instead, we allow a build
 * host to use a cross-compilation toolchain later to extract the
 * source location, from the raw data the kernel has provided on the
 * target system.
 *
 * However, collecting the call frames within the application to
 * determine the full context of a relax spot is not something we can
 * do purely from kernel space, notably because it depends on build
 * options we just don't know about (e.g. frame pointers availability
 * for the app, or other nitty-gritty details depending on the
 * toolchain). To solve this, we ask the application to send us a
 * complete backtrace taken from the context of a specific signal
 * handler, which we know is stacked over the relax spot. That
 * information is then stored by the kernel after some
 * post-processing, along with other data identifying the caller, and
 * made available through the /proc/xenomai/debug/relax vfile.
 *
 * Implementation-wise, xndebug_notify_relax and xndebug_trace_relax
 * routines are paired: first, xndebug_notify_relax sends a SIGSHADOW
 * request to userland when a relax spot is detected from
 * xnshadow_relax, which should then trigger a call back to
 * xndebug_trace_relax with the complete backtrace information, as
 * seen from userland (via the internal __xn_sys_backtrace
 * syscall). All this is ran on behalf of the relaxing thread, so we
 * can make a number of convenient assumptions (such as being able to
 * scan the current vma list to get detailed information about the
 * executable mappings that could be involved).
